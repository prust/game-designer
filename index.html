  <h1>Game Designer</h1>
  <p>Game Designer is a simple windows application designed to teach programming basics via visual coding blocks (similar to Scratch! and Hour of Code). It loads levels and worlds built with the Tiled map editor and allows the user to make them interactive via dragging-and-dropping code blocks.</p>
